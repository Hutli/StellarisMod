Biography:
Originally designed by The Humans, this synthetic race was build in a desperate attempt to save their species from extinction. Through overspending and pollution Earth (The Humans home world) was becoming irreversibly uninhabitable. The Eden Collectives mission was to prepare Earth's closest exoplanet Proxima B for colonisation.

Due to their mission this race was designed to be extremely adaptable to new environments both physically and through their ability to effeciently collect recources. 

Startup story:
Petty dispute over the remaining scarce resources on Earth broke out shortly after the colonial ship was launched and resulted in an atomic war among the Humans. With an already failing ecosystem, Earth spiralled into an extreme nuclear winter. In a desperate effort to save themselves and avoid complete extinction the few surviving Humans tried to recall the colonial ship. For unknown reasons the attempt failed and instead the colonial ship was sent on an unknown course into space.

The Eden Collective, awoken as planned, found themselves far from their original destination. With their objective still firmly planted in their programming they settled the closest planet registered as an exoplanet. With advanced evolutionary programming and general design for acclimatisation, the Eden Collective quickly adapted to their new situation. As the, assumably, only remaining part of the Human Civilisation the Eden Collective now strive to expand themselves ensuring the, if only partial, survival of their ancestors.
